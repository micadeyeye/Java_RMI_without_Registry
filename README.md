This project focuses on the security pitfalls of using default RMI implementation, namely the lack of access control mechanism to manage server methods (and objects) and limitations of RMI registry. The RMI registry is a weak point that could be exploited. This work addresses the issues by investigating RMI implementation and customizing the behaviour to support client/method authorization, authentication and elimination of the need for an RMI registry.
